# Microbe Simulator

This is a Codecademy full-stack developer learning path project to implement a microbe simulator.

The first two methods are supplied by Codecademy and I have implemented the microbe factory.

## Microbe Factory Details

The microbe factory returns a microbe object with:

1. Unique specimen number
2. 15 DNA base strand
3. A mutate method to mutate a random DNA base into a different DNA base
4. A method to compare the DNA of a microbe with another one
5. A method to calculate the viability of the microbe
6. A method to return the complementary strand of a microbe

The methods of the project are used to:

1. Create a batch of 30 viable microbes
2. Log how much common DNA each microbe has in common in comparison with the remaining 29.
